# ERC4337 Example Project

## Overview
This repository showcases a practical implementation of ERC4337, a standard for smart contract-based accounts, by demonstrating a complete workflow for minting an ERC721 token. The project involves setting up a smart contract environment on the Mumbai test network and executing user operations. Key components include:
- **EntryPoint**: Manages user operations.
- **AccountFactory**: Responsible for creating new accounts.
- **Paymaster**: Transactions sponsor for SimpleAccounts created from a specific AccountFactory address.
- **SimpleAccount**: A basic account structure for users.
- **ExampleContract**: A simple ERC721 token contract for minting tokens.

## Requisites
- Install the dependence with the command `npm install`.
- Ensure the `.env` file is updated based on the provided `.env.example`. It should include:
  - A private key with sufficient Mumbai MATIC to deploy the contracts and fund the wallet for user operations.
  - A Mumbai RPC URL for network connectivity.
- Update  the `addressesConfig.js` file after each deployment step.

## Deployment and Execution Steps
Follow these steps in order to deploy contracts and execute transactions:

### 1. Deploy the EntryPoint
This script deploys the EntryPoint contract, which is central to managing user operations as per the ERC4337 standard. It awaits the deployment and logs the address where the EntryPoint is deployed.

`npx hardhat run --network mumbai ./scripts/deploy_EntryPoint.js`

- Update the `entryPointAddress` in `addressesConfig.js`.

### 2. Deploy the AccountFactory
This script deploys the AccountFactory contract. The AccountFactory is responsible for creating new smart contract-based accounts. It takes the address of the previously deployed EntryPoint as a parameter.

`npx hardhat run --network mumbai ./scripts/deploy_AccountFactory.js`

- Update the `accountFactoryAddress` in `addressesConfig.js`.

### 3. Deploy the Paymaster
This script deploys the Paymaster contract, which covers transaction fees for SimpleAccounts created from the specified AccountFactory. The EntryPoint address and the AccountFactory address is passed as a parameters to the Paymaster.

`npx hardhat run --network mumbai ./scripts/deploy_Paymaster.js`

- Update the `paymasterAddress` in `addressesConfig.js`.

### 4. Deploy SimpleAccount
This script creates an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet. The EOA wallet is critical because it signs the SimpleAccount transactions on the network and providing a layer of control and security for the user's operations. Additionally, this script deploys the SimpleAccount contract using the AccountFactory. The SimpleAccount represents a basic account structure for users in the ERC4337 framework. 

`npx hardhat run --network mumbai ./scripts/deploy_simpleAccount.js`

- Update the `simpleAccountAddress` in `addressesConfig.js`.

### 5. Deploy ExampleContract
This script deploys the ExampleContract, a simple ERC721 token contract. This contract is used for minting tokens in this demonstration.

`npx hardhat run --network mumbai ./scripts/deploy_ExampleContract.js`

- Update the `exampleContractAddress` in `addressesConfig.js`.

### 6. Deposit Funds
This script is responsible for funding the necessary accounts to enable User Operations. It deposits funds into the EntryPoint contract for the Paymaster. This ensures that the Paymaster has sufficient balance to cover transaction fees for wallets created from the specified AccountFactory. Additionally, the script fund the EOA (Externally Owned Account) wallet that owns the SimpleAccount.

`npx hardhat run --network mumbai ./scripts/depositFunds.js`

### 7. Send User Operation
This script executes a user operation by interacting with the following contracts: EntryPoint, Paymaster, SimpleAccount, and ExampleContract. It prepares and sends a transaction to the EntryPoint contract, which typically involves a function call like safeMint from the ExampleContract, using the user's SimpleAccount.
The transaction is sponsored by the Paymaster, which covers the transaction fees, using the funds deposited earlier.

`npx hardhat run --network mumbai ./scripts/sendUserOp.js`

### 8. Test Script
 This script checks the results of the previous operation. It queries the ExampleContract for the latest tokenId and the token balance of the SimpleAccount, verifying the success of the minting operation.

`npx hardhat run --network mumbai ./scripts/test.js`
